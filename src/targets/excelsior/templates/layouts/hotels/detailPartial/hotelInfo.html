        WELCOME TO THE EXCELSIOR HOTEL
      </h2>
      <p class="HotelInfo__details--highlight">
        Committed to the idea that a life well-traveled is defined by a personal connection to the people, culture and
        lifestyles of the places we visit, the Excelsior Hotel offers discerning guests an authentic, residence-style
        experience in the heart of New York City’s Upper West Side. To complement our fashionable surroundings,
        we’ve designed a delightfully affordable pied-a-terre distinguished by relaxed yet sophisticated
        ambiance and unpretentious style.

      <p class="HotelInfo__details--description">
        The Excelsior is located within a beautifully restored landmark building, infusing classic design and
        architecture with contemporary comfort. In addition to swanky, Art Deco-inspired rooms, the hotel features a
        fitness center, Boardroom and Calle Ocho restaurant, which brings guests and neighborhood residents together
        for signature Latin fare and a locally famous weekend brunch complete with unlimited complimentary sangria.
